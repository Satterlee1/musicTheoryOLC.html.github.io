# musicTheoryOLC.html.github.io
The intent of this project initially is that it is a collection of the many open source resources for music theory in one place that is easily accessible to secondary school students (Specifically my Year 9-10 Music classes).

In the longer term, I can't imagine any reasons why the project cannot grow to become a fairly comprehensive resource for use in the classroom.

* I'd love to bring on a comprehensive aural package that is affordable/accessible to schools and students (perhaps Solfege could be dolled up and ported to the web somehow?)
* I'd love to see a comprehensive reference text for music students to use, AS WELL AS a comprehensive collection of worksheets and practice questions for students to use.
* And a great many other things......

I'm a pretty new at coding and my only experience has been a website here and there (not very good I might add) and some action script, like.... waaaay back. Please be kind if you have any comments.

That said, I am VERY passionate about open source and creative commons. While there will always be, and rightly so, a market for commercial software, I'm a strong believer that we (the collective community of the world) have a responsibility to contribute and not simply consume.

Finally..... I don't really know what I'm doing, so I'm starting small and dreaming big. If you think this is something that you could collaborate on then I'd love to hear from you.
